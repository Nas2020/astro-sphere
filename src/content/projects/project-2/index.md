## Project Overview

GastroGuide AI addresses a critical healthcare challenge: the complex and often frustrating diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Our solution combines advanced predictive AI with evidence-based medicine to transform how IBS is diagnosed and managed. By integrating seamlessly with existing clinical workflows, we provide physicians with actionable insights at the point of care, reducing diagnostic time and improving patient outcomes.

## The Challenge

IBS diagnosis presents multiple challenges in clinical settings:

- Physicians struggle with ambiguous, overlapping symptoms
- Diagnostic processes are time-consuming and error-prone
- Patients experience prolonged uncertainty and frustration
- Rome IV diagnostic criteria application varies significantly between practitioners
- Traditional methods fail to leverage modern technology effectively

## Technical Implementation

Our solution is built on a sophisticated healthcare technology stack:

- **SMART on FHIR**: Secure integration with Electronic Health Records for comprehensive patient data access
- **CDS Hooks**: Contextual decision support delivered at critical points in the clinical workflow
- **Rome IV Algorithm**: Precise implementation of established diagnostic criteria through AI
- **Advanced NLP**: Processing of unstructured clinical notes to extract symptom patterns
- **Predictive Models**: Machine learning algorithms trained on diverse gastroenterology datasets
- **AWS Infrastructure**: Scalable, HIPAA-compliant cloud architecture
- **Node.js & TypeScript**: Robust backend development ensuring system reliability

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Symptom Analysis**: AI-powered assessment of patient-reported symptoms
- **Evidence-Based Diagnosis Support**: Application of Rome IV criteria with consistent precision
- **EHR Integration**: Seamless connection with existing medical record systems
- **Comprehensive Patient Analysis**: Structured evaluation of medical history and symptom patterns
- **Differential Diagnosis**: Identification of conditions with similar presentations
- **Treatment Pathway Recommendations**: Evidence-based intervention suggestions
- **Audit Trails**: Transparent reasoning behind diagnostic recommendations
- **Physician Dashboard**: Intuitive interface presenting complex diagnostic information clearly

## Impact & Clinical Value

GastroGuide AI delivers measurable improvements to gastroenterology practice:

- **Reduced Diagnostic Time**: Decreases the typical IBS diagnostic journey from months to days
- **Increased Diagnostic Accuracy**: Consistent application of Rome IV criteria minimizes misdiagnosis
- **Enhanced Patient Experience**: Clear diagnostic pathways reduce uncertainty and frustration
- **Standardized Care**: Promotes consistent evidence-based practices across healthcare organizations
- **Reduced Unnecessary Testing**: Decreases reliance on exclusionary diagnostics
- **Improved Patient Outcomes**: Earlier, more accurate diagnosis leads to more effective treatment

## Future Development

Our ongoing research and development focuses on:

- Patient mobile wallet as a comprehensive health portal
- Expansion to other gastrointestinal conditions including IBD, GERD, and celiac disease
- Integration of genomic and microbiome data for personalized recommendations
- Additional clinical validation studies to further refine diagnostic algorithms
- Enhanced symptom tracking features for long-term condition management
- International adaptation to support global diagnostic practices
